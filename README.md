# node.js-work
This is the learning buildup to api integrations with confident cannabis
I am not currently familiar with the ins and outs of node.js but I'm hoping throuh some effort I will eventually be able to make my life using Confident Cannabis easier for my lab to use.  The sample tracking ahd reporting tools work fine but I would like some additional functionally related to batch printing labels and add a simplified data entry system.  If anyone one has and experience with this software, which is entirely webbased, any help would be appreciated
